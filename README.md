# Google-PlayStore-App-Analysis

Have you ever thought about building your own an iOS or Android app? If so, then you probably have wondered about how things work in the app stores. Today we'll replicate some of the app store analytics provided by companies like App Annie or Sensor Tower that helps inform development and app marketing strategies for many companies.



In this module, we will compare thousands of apps in the Google Play Store so that we can gain insight into:

How competitive different app categories (e.g., Games, Lifestyle, Weather) are

Which app category offers compelling opportunities based on its popularity

How many downloads you would give up by making your app paid vs. free

How much you can reasonably charge for a paid app

Which paid apps have had the highest revenue

How many paid apps will recoup their development costs based on their sales revenue
